> I'm a second year CS undergraduate at UCSB. In my spare time I often play video games (RPG, FPS, AVG, etc.) to relax. 

My ideas for the restroom project:
- Use Google Maps API to generate a shortest path from current location to the nearest restroom or the building that has restroom in it. 
- Attach photos for each restroom so that they can be found more easily. 
- Not limited to restrooms; vending machines or water fountains can also be added.
