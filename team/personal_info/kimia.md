My name is Kimia Majd. I'm a third year computer science major from San Jose, California. 

Some ideas I have for the project include 
    - a feature that informs the user of the bathroom that is closest to them
    - possibly a water fountain tracker as well
    - each bathroom should display how many stalls it has, as well as whether it is a male bathroom, female bathroom,
      gender neutral bathroom, or bathroom that accomodates those with disabilites
