I am a second year Computer Science major here at UCSB.
In my free time, I enjoy cooking, playing strategy games, and catching up on sleep.

For this project, I hope our team can work to create a functioning mobile app that displays bathrooms in the local area. Depending on time restrictions, we can work to add more descriptors for the bathrooms (size, number of stalls, water fountains nearby, etc.), however I hope that at the very least the app can be made working and easy to use (people who need to use the app don't have time to click around to find things, they need it to be quick!).
