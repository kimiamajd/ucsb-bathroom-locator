Attendanc: everyone
scribe: cameron

Derek: markers have been color coded, created a prototype for clickable buildings


Lucas: worked on automated testing, testing works on its own from the command line

roadblocks: github doesn't run the tests properly: it doesn't end

next steps: adding more testing and make the github tests end


Cameron: finished the settings tab, added 100 bathrooms

will continue bathrooms search on tuesday

roadblocks: settings tab code is a frakenstein of stack overflow code, it works but the gender variable is in terms of a color instead of a gender


Kimi: researched improved UI for collapseable list

roadblocks is how to get the icons and color coding to list with these other collapseable lists


Nick: fixed the draggability issue again, and added some bathrooms

planning to help work on the testing and the bathrooms list tab UI
