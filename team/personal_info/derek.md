My name is Derek Wang and I'm a 3rd year CS student. I like playing video games and watching anime.

For the project, I thought about developing a mobile app that has a map that gives you the nearby bathroom locations. I thought about having each location having lots of details that can be filled such as gender, number of bathrooms, location, floor, etc. I also thought it would be funny if users could rate the bathrooms with reviews. Lastly, I believe that we should first create the input bathroom function and just simply walk around campus and just input each bathroom we come across
