For this project, I hope to help create a mobile application that can help UCSB students find nearby bathrooms on campus. The app can include an interactive campus map with nearby bathrooms highlighted. It could also guide students like apple maps or google maps does when you enter a destination. The app could also allow users to rate bathrooms on campus.
