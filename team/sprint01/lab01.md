3. Made temporary name for project: UCSBB

4. Began creating User Journey and Problem Scenario (not done yet)

5. Discussed the minimum viable product (MVP)

MVP map:
* should center on the user’s location and indicate their location with a dot
* doesn’t have to be drag-able
* doesn’t have to be moveable
* should have some way of displaying surrounding locations (buildings, landmarks, etc.)

list of bathrooms:
* just a simple list (separate from the map, available from a toolbar or pulldown menu or something)
* has room number of bathroom (e.g. South Hall 1636)
