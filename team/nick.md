My name is Nick Arenberg, I'm a second year CS major from Campbell, California. It's a suburb of San Jose. 
I think a restroom finder would be useful to any student on campus, as I've personally been lost and 
unable to find the nearest barhroom. It should have a visual map of campus with markers for each bathroom, maybe different colored markers for male and female colored rooms, and each should have a 
description, mainly th room number, when it is selected. It might be fun to let people review bathrooms or 
contact campus if a bathrooom is dirty/clogged.
