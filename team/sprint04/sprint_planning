(see 2-18-3PM.md)
Date: 2/18/2020 Attendence: Everyone is here (Lucas, Cameron, Derek, Kimi, Nick, Jack)

Notes:
- assign at least 2 people to each major issue so that there is an extra set of eyes to check, test code, revise, etc.
- continue to use feature branches and make PRs, then have someone review them before they can be merged to testing
- make sure code is bug-free before making PR
- all minor issues have been completed or closed

Major features to work on moving forward:

Firebase Integration (Lucas and Jack)
Building Clickable Interface (Derek and Kimi)
Bathroom List UI (Kimi and Nick)
Testing (Lucas and Nick)
Settings Tab (Cameron and Derek)
