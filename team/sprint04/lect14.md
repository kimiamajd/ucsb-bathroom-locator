attendance: jack is absent

Derek: worked on displaying bathrooms from firebase on the maps tab as markers for now, roadblocks: jack's firebase integration code is minimally commented

Cameron: +60 bathrooms since monday

Kimi: put all the bathrooms on the google spreadsheet into firebase, next week: improve collapseable list

Lucas: pushed CI testing branch to master, every time a pull request is made, it will run the CI tests; also fixed the bugs with the gender neutral bathrooms in the bathrooms tab, roadblocks: the tests finish but somehow the process never ends, so implmented a forced end at 1 minute

Nick: wrote a bunch of test cases, to do: write more test cases
